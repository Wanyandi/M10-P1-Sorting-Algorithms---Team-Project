## Sorting-Algorithm
Welcome to Sorting Algorithm Program. A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.

This program is a small and handful collection of all sorting algorithms that tests how long it takes to sort out different data sets using different sorting- algorithm methods

### Objectives:

- Improve understanding of sorting algorithms and big-O notation
- Implementing sorting algorithms
- Compare the sorting algorithmâ€™s performance
 

### Tasks:

- Implement the following sorting algorithms
- Insertion sort
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Radix sort

This program is menu based and allows user to select 
1. The random list to be generated
2. Select the Sorting option menu

Once the user has selected the List to be generated and the sorting method, the program generates a random list of intergers which is not sorted.

The program jumps into the module 

### Time testing

After implementing the above sorting algorithm, you can test how long it will take to sort with random data sets of 1,000 10,000 100,000, and 1,000,000 numbers (in the range of 0 to 1,000,000).

### A table containing data that you collected from the timing step
............

### A chart that visually explains the results
..........

### Summarize your findings.
